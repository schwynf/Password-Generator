Password-Generator

--description--
This website probides an application that generates a new password using various characters and character length depending on user input. The website has been tested on the following browsers: [Google Chrome, Fire Fox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge]. All links stay within the website. Majority of the css is linked to Bootstrap so internet acces is required to render content in brower. Feel free to leave a comment negative or positive. I am always looking to improve the website. psss... Check console in inspect mode if you to want check validation of password per user input.
